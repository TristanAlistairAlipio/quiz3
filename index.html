      <h2>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</h2>
    </section>
    <div class="div">
      <p class="p1">The College of Industrial Technology (CIT) is located in Laoag City,<br> with an external campus in Paoay, Ilocos Norte. It was chosen in <br>1983 as one of the 21 public technological institutes in the Technical Vocational <br> Education Project (TVEP) of the then Department of Education, Culture, <br> and Sports (DECS) mandated to produce the needed manpower for industrial growth <br> and development in the country.
      The college was an accredited regional trade skills <br> training and testing 
       center in Region 1 by the Technical Education and Skills Development <br> Authority (TESDA) and a regional training center in ceramic by the Product Design <br>and Development Center of the Philippines.
      It also hosts a Toyota Technology Center <br>(TTC), one among 18 established in nominated partner schools in the country under the <br> Toyota Automotive Education Program (TAEP) of the Toyota Motor Philippines Foundation <br> (TMPF) Inc., which is envisioned to become the regional skills development center in <br>automotive servicing.</p>
     <p class="p2">The University is Deputized by CHED to implement the Expanded <br>Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP) with the <br>BS INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY as one of the ETEEAP Degree Programs <br> offered by the College. The ETEEAP is a comprehensive educational assessment program <br> at the tertiary level that recognizes, accredits, and gives equivalencies to knowledge, skills, <br>attitudes, and values gained by individuals from relevant work. This program recognizes <br>that education and the acquisition of  higher expertise also take place beyond the confines <br> of the classroom. The BSIT degree may be granted to individuals  through the recognition <br> of their knowledge and skills gained from non-formal or informal learning.The recognition <br> of the  knowledge and skills are done through equivalency and assessment by assessors <br> of the College.</p>
